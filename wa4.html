<h1 style="background-color: Aquamarine">WA 4: Rick and Morty</h1>


<p style="color:White">	Out of all the media and entertainment masterpieces released over the last couple of decades there is all but one that stands in its own genre, format, and safe to say dimension. Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon the creators of Rick and Morty conjured up a series that became so beloved and intellectual probing while also staying relevant and humorous over the past decade. The series however only 4 seasons long with 10 episodes hungers its audience for more by including several aspects that a series can only strive to deliver to its audience.
</p>


<p style="color:White">The show is a mixed bag or blended up masterpiece that incorporates traits that are humorous, clever, ironic, nerdy, pop-culture, and existential. It's difficult to categorize a series such as itself as the episodes it entails are beyond original and gives the audience a psychedelic nature to the entire experience. A lot of the fanbase are millennials, the beauty of Rick and Morty is that it feels like the show is never content to just spin its wheels and churn out an average run of the mill episode. Each episode is unique in its own way by literally diving into other dimensions you would never think of while also keeping a consistent philosophy and continuity of the series in line.
</p>


<p style="color:White">From my personal experience of watching the series over 10 times there are always situations where I realize certain parts of the episode that I had missed the first or second or third time around watching it. Coherently, Rick and Morty's episodes can be comprehended in multiple ways. For example, on the surface level of casually mindlessly watching, the viewer can still enjoy what is being presented to them without giving the show much intellectual thought. On the flipside, I've watched it intently and focused on what each character is saying and doing and this is when I've been able to unlock aspects of foreshadow, existential principles, and philosophical discussions. I believe the shows creators did this intentionally as the viewer can interpret each episode in their own way allowing for repeatability which for someone like me that does not re-watch a lot of shows more than twice is crucial. </p>


<p style="color:White">Lastly, Rick and Morty provides its users with a sense of psychotherapy by pushing the audience into watching the show with others to freely discuss their thoughts whether its based on the episode itself or a thought that was uprooted by watching. I've never met someone that told me they watched Rick and Morty and didn't enjoy it. Even the people that arent hardcore fans or have only watched it once will still never shy away to not watching it when brought up with their friends. There is a lot of light and dark humor within the episodes and thus any sort of friend group or individual from any background will get a kick out of it. 
</p>


<p style="color:White">Overall, Rick and Morty is impossible to describe and categorize into one entity. With the millions of viewers and even more millions of dollars the show has brought in it truly is a masterpiece. When compared to one of my other favorite shows of Game of Thrones, no matter how much I loved the majority of the seasons there were always areas or parts where I felt were lacking or the directors could have made better. A show like game of thrones is flooded with criticism and faultiness within the series despite being one the greatest tv shows of all time. However, with rick and morty a series that brings moral lessons, thought provoking conversations, and never ending content is what makes it brilliant. Despite everything listed the only true way to experience something like Rick and Morty is to just simply watch it for yourself.
