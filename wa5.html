<p>As an individual my qualities reflect my character. Throughout my life I’ve always had an interest with digital technology, statistics, and the future. I enjoy spending a lot of time analyzing data from all corners of the internet and how to visualize them in the most creative yet effective way possible. My passion for creativity is also reflected into my hobbies as I create AMV’s, video edits, and mixes. UX/UI design is the cornerstone of these interests.</p>
