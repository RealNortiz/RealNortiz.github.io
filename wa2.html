<p>During the first month of 2021, a year the entire human civilization had been waiting for due to the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the greatest socio economic phenomena occurred. An online forum page known as Reddit banded together within the WallStreetBets subreddit to turn the tide in a story that the media called a classic David vs Goliath scenario. To simplify things, big corporations on wall street put a lot of money and essentially bet that the company Gamestop (GME) would decrease within the duration of the month and thus by borrowing these stocks they were trying to make a profit. On the flip side, these redditors decided to all come together to buy a lot of this stock which in turn would raise the share price even though in reality the company's stock wasn’t reflecting the true economic nature of Gamestop. With the growth of GME rising over 1500% in a week, hedge funds were forced to compensate for each share and put more money into at the time of them purchasing a very cheap share. These companies lost millions of dollars in the process and in turn made a bad bet or financial decision. The controversy surrounding the situation was that certain brokerages were halting people from buying stock which is shady and these 1% of the 1% group of people were getting bailed out. In my opinion, the stock market is universal and the consequences of one's decisions are the same for anyone. Why are hedge funds getting bailed out for making a wrong decision when an everyday average person could lose money on a stock and not reap the same benefits. This is clear corruption and delegitimizes the economy. Hedge funds short sell and do this everyday behind everyones back due to the fact that they are in the position to do so. However, when they got hit with “ a taste of their own medicine” they ran to the government to try and shut it all down. As an information science student, I was very intrigued by the whole situation as it's an example of how the data laid out and what they predicted was false leading. I instantly think of how data visualization can be manipulated ever so slightly to reflect the information in a different light then what is actually happening. Overall, I side with reddit and the amatuer traders that took part as it showed the true nature of people at the top of our nation. They dont look out for us, in fact I believe they only look out for themselves and their circle of influence. In terms of regulation of the matter, their needs to be major implications being brought to the table. I don't believe these major companies should get a slap on the wrist but instead the transparency surrounding the stock market and how money flows through needs to be increased. It's hard to imagine or be hopeful for this to happen as wall street works hand in hand with big politicians and if their friends are hurting they will skew any power they have to back them up without thinking about the overall wellness of the population.</p>
